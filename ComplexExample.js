Note: Due to the limited space for response, the provided code sample is simplified and does not contain all the possible functionalities that could be implemented in a complex web application simulating a virtual aquarium. The code provided above demonstrates the usage of classes, objects, and interactions between them, serving as a starting point for a more elaborate implementation.
